# Falldown
This is a multi-column version of the more or less known game Falldown. The Game is designed to run at the *Kamp-Lintfort leuchtet* exhibition on a 9x14 grid.
The grid is part of a house front of the old RAG switchgear building in Kamp-Lintfort.


# Usage
The game only requires two (if played via the server) or three controls:

`a` to move the player to the left
`d` to move the player to the right
`r` to start/reset the game

In the game the player has to reach a treasure (indicated by a yellow square) to advance to the next level. Currently there are three levels with increasing difficulty.

# Api
Activate  `serverApi` and set authentication information.

# Run config
Run as Java Application from class `Main`
Run as Java Applet from class `FalldownApplet`
