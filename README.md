# Falldown
This is a multi-column version of the more or less known game Falldown. The Game is designed to run at the *Kamp-Lintfort leuchtet* exhibition on a 9x14 grid.
The grid is part of a house front of the old RAG switchgear building in Kamp-Lintfort.

In the game the player has to reach a treasure (indicated by a yellow square) to advance to the next level. Currently there are three levels with increasing difficulty.
